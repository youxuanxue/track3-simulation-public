# Track 3 — Semantic-Preserving Market Simulation

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 3 asks one question: **can you build a faster market simulator that still behaves
like a real stock exchange?**

You receive the open-source **ABIDES** simulator as your starting point. ABIDES is correct
but slow. Your job is to produce a faster version — submitted as a Docker image — that:
1. Passes a correctness check over the 72 public units plus a sealed scenario set (the **semantic regression suite**)
2. Passes a 4-metric realism check (the **stylized-fact admissibility gate**)
3. Is then ranked by speed (`events_per_sec` on a sealed benchmark scenario)

Only simulators that pass both gates receive a leaderboard rank. Speed without correctness
scores zero.

**Scope.** Track 3 is about the *discrete-event market simulation* only — the `abides-core` kernel and
the `abides-markets` exchange / agents / order book. You do **not** need `abides-gym` (the
reinforcement-learning wrapper); it is out of scope here, and its legacy dependencies (`gym`, `ray`, …)
are unnecessary and do not build on modern Python. Install `abides-core` + `abides-markets` only —
by naming those two subdirectories, as Step 1 of the quick start does. ABIDES has no top-level
package and no `[all]` extra, so there is no repository-root install that could honour this scope
anyway.

New to this track? Read `docs/CONCEPTS.md` first — it defines every term in plain English.
Then come back here for the submission format and quick-start steps.

## What this public repo contains

This repo is your starter kit. It contains:
- The public half of the regression suite (65 scenarios, with reference traces)
- The throughput timer (for local benchmarking)
- The ABIDES baseline: the `abides_fork` `simulate` adapter and a `Dockerfile` that fetches
  upstream ABIDES at the pinned commit and builds the baseline image (`baselines/`)
- Documentation in `docs/`

It does **not** contain:
- The sealed scenarios used in the final correctness check (how many there are is not published)
- The sealed reference traces those scenarios compare against
- The sealed throughput benchmark scenario (`SS-BENCH`)
- The final scorer logic (the private gate-and-rank implementation)

---

## Submission format

Your submission is a **Docker image** that accepts two verbs — `simulate` (a single scenario)
and `simulate-batch` (a batch of scenarios run in one pass):

```bash
docker run --rm \
    --network none \
    -v /path/to/scenario.json:/input/scenario.json:ro \
    -v /path/to/output/:/output/ \
    <your-image>:latest \
    simulate \
    --config /input/scenario.json \
    --out /output/trace.parquet
```

For batched multi-scenario throughput runs (family 6, throughput-scale), the image also accepts
the `simulate-batch` verb, which runs N independent sub-scenarios in one pass:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    --network none \
    -v /path/to/scenarios/:/input/scenarios:ro \
    -v /path/to/output/:/output/ \
    <your-image>:latest \
    simulate-batch \
    --batch-dir /input/scenarios \
    --out-dir /output
```

`simulate-batch` writes `/output/<sub>/{trace,message_trace}.parquet` + `events.json` for each
sub-scenario, plus an aggregate `/output/batch_events.json`. Each sub-scenario is checked under a
per-sub **isolation gate** — its output must reproduce the trace it produces when run in isolation —
alongside the aggregate throughput number.

For a single `simulate` run, the image must write the following files to `/output/`:

### `trace.parquet`

A columnar Parquet file (Snappy-compressed) with one row per exchange event. Required
columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `t_ns` | int64 | Event timestamp in nanoseconds since simulation epoch |
| `agent_id` | int32 | Originating agent identifier |
| `msg_type` | string | Event type (see below) |
| `side` | string | `BID`, `ASK`, or null |
| `price` | int64 | Price in integer ticks |
| `size` | int64 | Order size in shares |
| `order_id` | int64 | Unique order identifier, stable across fill/cancel events |

Valid `msg_type` values: `ORDER_SUBMITTED`, `ORDER_ACCEPTED`, `ORDER_FILLED`,
`PARTIAL_FILL`, `ORDER_CANCELLED`, `ORDER_REPLACED`, `QUOTE_UPDATE`.

### `events.json`

A flat JSON file with these required fields:

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "<UUID matching the scenario config>",
  "seed": 42,
  "n_events": 1482931,
  "wall_clock_sec": 12.4,
  "events_per_sec": 119591.2,
  "trace_sha256": "<SHA-256 of trace.parquet>",
  "peak_memory_bytes": 2147483648,
  "gpu_seconds": 3.1
}
```

The `peak_memory_bytes` and `gpu_seconds` fields are resource telemetry (feeding the secondary
diagnostics in `throughput/`); the other six fields are the core record.

The `events_per_sec` value must be consistent with `n_events ÷ wall_clock_sec` within
±5%. The harness verifies this consistency check and disqualifies submissions that report
inflated throughput.

### `message_trace.parquet`

A message-level record of the kernel's inter-agent message ledger. It feeds the
latency/causality checks and the g3.5 protocol-fidelity gate.

**The card decides, not the family — and most units require it.** `requires_message_ledger = true`
is set on **59 of the 72** public units, well beyond the exchange-protocol and reactive-agent
families this page previously named. Read **`[scoring.params].requires_message_ledger`** from the
unit's `card.toml` rather than inferring from the family; "may omit it" applies only to the 13 units
whose card actually says so.

```toml
[scoring.params]
requires_message_ledger = true
```

The key is under `[scoring.params]`, not `[scoring]` — measured, 72 of 72 cards put it there, and
`_CardPolicy` reads `card["scoring"]["params"]`. A lookup on the wrong table returns nothing, which
reads as "not required" and lands you back in the failure this section exists to prevent.

Batch units need one **per sub-scenario**: `score_subs` requires a ledger for every sub
unconditionally, so a batch card reading `false` does not exempt it.

### `batch_events.json` (batch runs only)

Written once per `simulate-batch` run at `/output/batch_events.json`. Aggregates the batch:
`n_scenarios`, `total_events`, **`wall_clock_sec`**, `events_per_sec`, and a `per_scenario`
breakdown.

`wall_clock_sec` is **required**: `check_aggregate` reads `total_events`, `wall_clock_sec` and
`events_per_sec` together, and a missing key fails the entire batch with
`"non-numeric batch_events fields"` — a message that does not name the field it wanted.

### Firewall

Your container runs with `--network none`. It may not make any outbound network requests
during simulation. All data (scenario config, latency CDF files, oracle CSV files) is
provided via the mounted `/input/` directory.

---

## The two baselines

### Baseline 1 — ABIDES Python (the throughput floor)

The reference baseline is the unmodified ABIDES Python engine pinned to a specific commit,
driven by the `abides_fork` `simulate` adapter. ABIDES itself is not vendored here; the
`baselines/Dockerfile` fetches it at the pinned commit at build time and layers the adapter
on top. Build the image and run the throughput timer to measure the floor you must beat:

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t track3-abides-baseline:latest baselines/
python throughput/timer.py --image track3-abides-baseline:latest \
    --scenario regression_suite/scenarios/as06_throughput_fast.json
```

`--scenario` is required; `as06_throughput_fast.json` is the public throughput example.

See `baselines/README.md` for the pinned commit, the adapter internals, and
`baselines/build_and_validate.sh` (build + validate against the public reference traces).

The baseline `events_per_sec` on the sealed benchmark is what your submission must exceed
to receive the `T3_THROUGHPUT_NONIMPROVING` note removed from your record. Being slower
than ABIDES does not disqualify you — you still receive a rank — but it is noted on the
leaderboard.

### Baseline 2 — vectorized reference (internal performance ceiling)

An in-house NumPy-vectorized limit-order-book simulator developed by the QFBench team. It is
**not open-sourced** and is not shipped in this repo; it serves as the admissibility
cross-check reference and the upper performance reference point. The logical interface a fast
submission must satisfy (the `simulate` CLI plus the output schema) is documented in
`baselines/README.md` §2. You may implement any internal architecture — vectorized NumPy,
Numba, Cython, Rust via PyO3, … — as long as that CLI and the output schema are preserved.

---

## How the regression suite works

The harness runs your Docker image on each scenario and checks the output.
The scenarios come from two sources:

- **65 public scenarios** (in `regression_suite/scenarios/`) — you can see the configs and
  the reference traces. Use these for development.
- **Sealed scenarios** (held in the Track-3 private repository, not distributed) — you cannot
  see these configs or traces, and their number is not published. The harness loads them
  automatically in the evaluation environment.

### Running the public scenarios locally

The reference traces ship inside each unit, at `units/<slug>/`. The regression runner looks
them up by `scenario_id`, so build the local cache once before your first run — it is a
build artifact, gitignored, and derived entirely from `units/`:

```bash
python regression_suite/build_reference_cache.py
```

If you cloned without Git LFS content, run `git lfs pull` first; the builder refuses to
create a cache full of 130-byte pointer stubs.

```bash
python regression_suite/run_regression.py \
    --candidate-image <your-image>:latest \
    --scenarios-dir regression_suite/scenarios/ \
    --reference-dir regression_suite/reference_traces/ \
    --output-dir run_outputs/ \
    --workers 4
```

All 65 public scenarios should pass against the ABIDES baseline before you start
optimizing. If they do not, your environment has a problem — check Docker version and
bind-mount permissions.

### Tolerance model (two tiers)

**Tier A** (Families 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 — exact): your trace must have the same row count as the
reference, the same fill events in the same order at the same prices and sizes, exact event
coverage in both directions (no missing events, no extra ones), and Kendall-τ ≥ 0.999 on the event
ordering. The only numeric tolerance is ±1 µs on event timestamps.

**Tier B** (Families 2, 4, 5 — statistical): your mid-price series must be statistically
close to the reference — return-distribution KS ≤ 0.08 (the same calibrated KS check as the
stylized-fact gate) and time-averaged spread within ±10 bps.

**There is no majority rule, in either tier.** Every scenario is graded on its own and every
scenario must pass; a single failure anywhere is inadmissible. Earlier revisions of this page said
80% of each Tier-B family had to pass — no scorer implements that, so do not budget for it.

---

## How the stylized-fact admissibility gate works

Before ranking, the harness checks that your simulator produces realistic market statistics
on the Family 5 (calibration) scenarios. All four checks must pass:

| Check | Ceiling | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| Return distribution KS distance | ≤ 0.08 | Wrong return shape overall |
| ACF of \|r_t\| error (RMS over lags 1, 5, 10, 20, 50) | ≤ 0.12 | Missing volatility clustering |
| Hill tail exponent absolute error (top-100 order stats) | ≤ 1.5 | Tails too thin or too fat |
| Depth distribution JS divergence (20-bin quote-size histograms) | ≤ 0.10 | Wrong order-book depth structure |

**All four are computed locally too, including the depth divergence.**
`run_regression.py` builds the candidate and reference depth histograms itself (via
`semantics.depth_histogram`) and passes them to the same `stylized_fact_report` the sealed scorer
calls, so `stylized_fact_report.json` carries all four numbers. An earlier revision of this page
said the depth check ran only at sealed scoring; it does not.

> **One KS, one ceiling.** The return-distribution KS above (≤ 0.08) is the *same*
> statistic and *same* calibrated ceiling used by the Tier-B statistical check — the 0.08
> comes from the natural run-to-run variation of correct simulations. There is a single
> return-distribution KS check, applied wherever a distributional comparison is needed.

Get these numbers locally by running the regression suite: `run_regression.py` writes a
stylized-fact report per scenario as it goes.

```bash
cat run_outputs/<scenario_id>/stylized_fact_report.json
# {"ks": 0.0, "acf_abs_l2": 0.0, "hill_abs": 0.0, "depth_js": 0.0}
```

Running the unmodified baseline against its own reference traces gives 0.0 everywhere, as above —
that is the expected reading before you change anything, not an empty result.

`<scenario_id>` is the UUID from the scenario's `scenario.json`, which is also the directory name
under `run_outputs/` and `reference_traces/`.

> `qfbench2_common.scoring.stylized_facts` is a **library module, not a command**. It defines no
> `argparse` parser and no `__main__` block, so
> `python -m qfbench2_common.scoring.stylized_facts --candidate ... --reference ...` exits 0,
> ignores both flags and prints nothing — which reads as "no problems found". Earlier revisions of
> this page published it as a command; it never was one. Import it if you want it directly:
> `from qfbench2_common.scoring.stylized_facts import stylized_fact_report, admissible`.

---

## How throughput is measured

For admissible submissions, the ranked number is `events_per_sec`, **measured by the organizer's
runner, never read from your `events.json`**. Per unit:

1. The candidate image is run several times on the same scenario. How many repeats, and whether
   the first is discarded as warm-up, are committed in advance in the evaluation plan — they are
   not chosen after the fact from what was observed.
2. The first repeat is discarded as warm-up (JIT/XLA compilation, cold page cache, import
   overhead), per that same pre-commitment.
3. Every remaining repeat must be individually valid *and* must have produced the same output
   bytes and the same event count as the run that was scored. A submission whose repeats disagree
   is refused rather than having its best repeat kept.
4. Each repeat's rate is the runner's own event count (the parquet footer row count) divided by
   the runner's own wall clock. The unit's score is the **median** of those rates.

Your self-reported `events_per_sec` is still checked for internal consistency (g1: within ±5% of
`n_events ÷ wall_clock_sec`; g3: `n_events` equal to the real row count), but it is not the ranked
quantity and no branch of the production scorer reads it. See
`qfbench2_track_simulation/telemetry.py`.

Ranking is by `events_per_sec` descending (`LEADERBOARD_SORT = "desc"`), aggregated over the
evaluation roster, with the sealed benchmark scenario (`SS-BENCH`) as the throughput-scale
centrepiece. A bootstrap confidence interval is reported alongside the score; resampling is by
scenario **family** rather than by unit, because units within a family share a generator and an
agent mix and so are correlated (see `cluster_key` in `qfbench2_track_simulation/scoring.py`).
Tie-breaking below the score is a platform-level rule and is not specified in this repository —
do not assume the CI lower bound decides it.

Measure your local baseline:

```bash
python throughput/timer.py --image <your-image>:latest \
    --scenario regression_suite/scenarios/as06_throughput_fast.json
```

Note: the local measurement uses the public throughput example (smaller parameters). The
sealed benchmark is harder. Local throughput is a directional guide, not a predictor of
your leaderboard rank.

### Secondary diagnostics (reported, not ranked)

The primary leaderboard rank stays raw `events_per_sec`. Alongside it, the harness reports —
but never ranks or gates on — a set of diagnostics computed offline in `throughput/`:

- **speedup** vs. the CPU-ABIDES baseline, **efficiency** (events/sec per GPU-hour or per
  CPU-core-hour), and **memory efficiency** (events per peak resident byte) — `throughput/diagnostics.py`.
- a **speed–realism Pareto frontier** over (throughput, stylized-fact realism) — `throughput/frontier.py`.
- four **special awards** — Best GPU Acceleration, Best Speed-Realism Frontier, Best
  Latency-Semantics Preservation, Best Systems Diagnosis — `throughput/awards.py`.
- an optional submitted **SimProfile** (`profile.json`: per-component timing, `gpu_utilization`,
  `peak_memory_bytes`), validated against the run's measured wall-clock and memory by
  `throughput/simprofile.py`, feeding Best Systems Diagnosis. It is diagnostic only, never an
  admissibility gate.

Generate the offline report with `python -m throughput.report`.

## Installing the shared toolkit

All scoring logic lives in the shared toolkit, which ships from its own public repository.
Install it from there:

```bash
pip install "qfbench2-common @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.3.1#subdirectory=common"
```

> ### Install the pinned tag, not a branch
>
> `Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public` carries the `qfbench2-common` package, and `v2.3.1` is the
> tag CI installs (`QFBENCH2_COMMON_REF` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and the tag the scorer
> runs. **Pin a tag rather than installing from a branch** — an unpinned toolkit is how a local
> result and a scored result come to disagree without either side noticing.
>
> Requires **Python 3.13 or newer**. On 3.12 the install resolves and then fails at import with
> `ImportError: cannot import name 'StrEnum'` — that is the interpreter, not the package.
>
> Please do not vendor or reimplement the toolkit. The scorer imports the same code, and a local
> copy that drifts from it is the one failure mode this package exists to prevent.

Do not copy-paste scoring code into your repo — it will drift from the canonical version.

---

## Quick-start (6 steps)

**Step 1** — Fork ABIDES and install it. Note the `cd` back: every later step runs
from *this* repository, not from the ABIDES checkout.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/abides-jpmc-public
(cd abides-jpmc-public && pip install -e abides-core -e abides-markets)
pip install "qfbench2-common @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.3.1#subdirectory=common"
```

The third line pins the toolkit tag — see "Installing the shared toolkit" above, which is where
that pin is described. Steps 3 and 4 import the toolkit, so run all three lines before them.

ABIDES is a multi-package repository: it has no top-level `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml` and no
`[all]` extra, so `pip install -e ".[all]"` from its root exits 1 with *"does not appear to be a
Python project"*. Name the two subdirectories instead — which is also what the Scope note above
asks for, since installing them individually is what leaves `abides-gym` out.

Neither subpackage declares any dependency of its own (their `setup.cfg` files carry no
`install_requires`), so the `pip install` on the second line is not optional: without it
`import abides_core` fails on `numpy`, and `import abides_markets.utils` on `scipy`.
`abides_markets.models.order_size_model` additionally imports `pomegranate`, which the baseline
image patches out at build time (`baselines/patches/order_size_model.pomegranate-free.patch`). For
the exact pinned stack the reference traces were generated with — and how to apply that patch to a
local checkout — see `baselines/README.md`.

**Step 2** — Build the reference-trace cache. `run_regression.py` resolves references by
`scenario_id` under `regression_suite/reference_traces/`, which is **gitignored and empty in a
fresh clone** — it is a build artifact derived from `units/`. Skipping this makes step 3 look
like a scenario failure. See "Running the public scenarios locally" above for the detail.

```bash
git lfs pull                                    # the builder refuses pointer stubs
python regression_suite/build_reference_cache.py
```

**Step 3** — Run the public regression suite against the unmodified baseline:

```bash
python regression_suite/run_regression.py \
    --candidate-image track3-abides-baseline:latest \
    --scenarios-dir regression_suite/scenarios/ \
    --reference-dir regression_suite/reference_traces/ \
    --output-dir run_outputs/ --workers 4
```

All 65 public scenarios must pass. If they do not, stop and fix your environment.

**Step 4** — Read the baseline stylized facts. Step 3 already computed them; there is no separate
command to run (see "How the stylized-fact admissibility gate works" above for why):

```bash
cat run_outputs/<scenario_id>/stylized_fact_report.json
```

**Step 5** — Measure baseline throughput:

```bash
python throughput/timer.py --image track3-abides-baseline:latest \
    --scenario regression_suite/scenarios/as06_throughput_fast.json
```

Record this number. It is your improvement target.

**Step 6** — Implement your accelerated simulator. Common approaches:
- Replace the Python limit-order-book core with a compiled extension (see
  `baselines/README.md` §2 for the interface contract your `simulate` CLI must satisfy).
- Vectorize agent stepping with NumPy.
- Re-implement the matching engine in Rust or C++ and call it from Python via a C
  extension module.

Whatever approach you take, re-run the regression suite and stylized-fact checker after
each change. Do not let correctness slip.

There is no top-level `scoring/` package; an earlier revision of this tree showed one. The public
scoring code is the `qfbench2_track_simulation/` package above, which is what
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` lints, type-checks and tests.
