"""The Track 3 metric domain: what the C1 clip ceiling must be, and why.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 3 ranks on events/sec, which has no natural upper bound, but frozen ruling R-2 requires a
finite ``metric.domain.max`` so that real scores can be clipped into the same domain the
participant-failure value ``W = 0.0`` lives in. Somebody therefore has to choose a number. The
shipped C1 simulation fixture chose **2,000,000 events/sec**, and the agent that wrote it recorded
that it had invented the figure because the freeze demanded a finite maximum and supplied none.

**That number is refused here, and it is refused on measurement rather than on taste.** A batch
unit ranks on the *aggregate* rate across its markets, so the attainable ceiling scales with batch
width; 2e6 sits *below* the competitive band this package has long cited for a batch only eight
markets wide (a band since withdrawn as never measured — see the table below, which is why the
ceiling is derived from the physical bound rather than from that band), and two orders of
magnitude below the widest batch the track ships. A ceiling below an attainable honest
score does not bound an exploit — it silently deletes the top of the leaderboard and ties every
strong submission at the same clipped value.

The replacement is not another constant. It is a **rule evaluated against the roster being
scored**, :func:`required_domain_max`, plus :func:`assert_domain_max_covers_roster`, which the
production scorer calls before it ranks anything. An invented ceiling cannot silently govern the
top again, because a plan whose ceiling would clip an honest submission is refused as an organizer
fault instead of quietly compressing the board.

## The derivation, from published figures only

**None of the events/sec figures below was measured on the evaluation fleet.** They were written
2026-06-23 against the hardware this repository described at the time — not the B200 hosts, and not
the gVisor sandbox every ranked run executes under. They are used here only to derive a ceiling
that must sit ABOVE every attainable honest score, which is the one direction in which being wrong
is free (see the asymmetry below). Do not read any of them as a target.

| Quantity | Value | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| Unmodified ABIDES baseline | ~65,000 events/sec | NOT measured on the evaluation fleet; `baselines/README.md` §3 |
| Internal vectorized reference | ~400,000 events/sec | NOT measured on the evaluation fleet; same section |
| Competitive band, per market | 150,000-600,000 events/sec | Never measured, and WITHDRAWN from `baselines/README.md` §3 as fabricated. Retained here only as the historical input the ceiling was derived from |
| Physical per-market ceiling | 1e7 events/sec | :data:`MAX_PER_MARKET_EVENTS_PER_SEC`, below — a chosen bound, not a measurement |
| Widest batch unit | roster-dependent | ``<unit>/batch.json`` on the organizer side |

**The repository's own shipped data contradicts the 65,000 figure.** The 65 public
``units/*/events.json``, all written by the same pinned baseline, record a geometric mean of
**13,793 events/sec** (range 3,471-18,046) — about **4.7x below** 65,000. The hardware behind those
runs is not recorded either, and their ``wall_clock_sec`` covers the simulation loop rather than the
whole container, so they do not replace a fleet measurement; they do show that 65,000 is the figure
least likely to be right. The ranking floor is UNCHANGED by this note, and neither number is read
by the code here: see :data:`ABIDES_BASELINE_EVENTS_PER_SEC` and `baselines/README.md` §3 for what
the floor is actually compared against.

:data:`MAX_PER_MARKET_EVENTS_PER_SEC` is **not new**. It is the plausibility ceiling this package
has published since the harness-measurement handoff was written, chosen then as "more than an order
of magnitude above the top of the competitive band, so no honest submission can reach it". What
changed is its job. It used to be the last line of defence against a fabricated wall clock, and its
own docstring conceded it was "a plausibility bound, NOT an anti-cheat". The wall clock is now
host-measured in C2 and the event count is the Runner's parquet-footer count checked against the
reference, so neither half of the fraction is the participant's any more. The constant is therefore
free to do the one job a clip ceiling actually has under R-2: sit **above every attainable honest
score**, so clipping is inert for real submissions and only ever binds a value that could not have
been produced.

That is the asymmetry that decides the number. `W = 0.0` is the domain *minimum*, so the exploit
R-2 exists to close — a failure scoring better than a real result — is closed by the floor and is
untouched by the ceiling. A ceiling that is too high costs nothing; a ceiling that is too low
deletes real ranking information. So the ceiling is chosen generously and by derivation, never
tightly and by guess.

## What this means for the shipped fixture

`qfbench2_common/contracts/fixtures/c1/simulation_final.expanded.json` currently carries
``domain.max = 2000000.0``. For a roster of single-market units the required value is
:data:`MAX_PER_MARKET_EVENTS_PER_SEC` (1e7); for a roster containing batch units it is that figure
times the widest batch in the roster. The Hub owns the fixture, so this module supplies the rule
and the scorer enforces it.
