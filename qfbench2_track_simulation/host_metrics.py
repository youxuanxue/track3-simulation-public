"""The DEVELOPER-profile throughput reader. Nothing here can produce a ranked score.

## Executive summary (read this first)

This module used to be the read side of a worker->scorer handoff that decided the leaderboard. It
is not that any more, and the change is deliberate rather than cosmetic.

The old contract was: prefer a harness measurement from ``host_metrics.json``, and **fall back to
the submission's self-reported rate** when none was present. The fallback was load-bearing in the
worst way — the common CodaBench ingestion path never wrote the file, so no harness measurement
ever existed and every production unit ranked on a number the submission chose. The consistency
checks around it pinned ``events_per_sec == n_events / wall_clock_sec`` and pinned ``n_events`` to
the real trace rows, but ``wall_clock_sec`` was compared against nothing, so a self-consistent
triple with a shrunken clock passed all of them. The only remaining bound was a plausibility
ceiling that this file's own comment already described as "a plausibility bound, NOT an
anti-cheat", roughly seventeen times the top of the honest competitive band.

The producer now exists: C2 carries host-measured timing, per-repeat records and Runner-measured
parquet-footer row counts. :mod:`qfbench2_track_simulation.telemetry` consumes it and is the only
source of a ranked rate. **The participant-rate fallback is removed from every rankable path**, and
what remains here is a *separately named developer profile* for local practice runs against a
harness that cannot produce trusted timing.

Everything this module returns is stamped ``rankable = False``. There is no environment flag that
promotes it. A caller that wants an official number calls :mod:`telemetry` and, when the evidence
is absent, gets an organizer fault — which is the honest outcome, because Track 3's score *is* a
measurement and a missing measurement is missing evidence rather than a low score.

File layout, unchanged, for the local harness that still writes it::

    {"t3-fastlob-core": {"host_events_per_sec": 118402.5, "host_wall_clock_sec": 12.4,
                         "host_n_events": 1468190, "host_gpu_seconds": 3.1,
                         "host_peak_memory_bytes": 2147483648,
                         "node_fingerprint": {...}}}

Stdlib-only on purpose: the CI job that guards it installs no scientific stack, and the guard is
more honest for being loadable without one.
