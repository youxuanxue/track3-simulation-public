"""Track 3's contribution to the C3 sanitation policy: the exact output allowlist and the bounds.

C3 says the participant's output directory and the scoring program's input directory are not the
same directory, and that each track contributes the exact set of relative paths its submissions may
write. This module is Track 3's contribution, in one place, so the production Runner, the local
developer harness and the tests all bound the same set.

Track 3 outputs, and nothing else:

| Unit shape | Allowed relative paths |
|---|---|
| single-market | ``trace.parquet``, ``events.json``, ``message_trace.parquet``, ``profile.json`` |
| batch | ``batch_events.json`` plus, per declared sub, ``<sub>/{trace,message_trace}.parquet``, ``<sub>/events.json`` and ``<sub>/profile.json`` |

``profile.json`` is the OPTIONAL Best Systems Diagnosis sidecar. ``docs/PROFILING.md`` tells a
participant to drop it next to ``trace.parquet`` in ``/output`` and ``throughput/simprofile.py``
calls it "a submission output sidecar"; the cross-submission assembler that consumes it lives
outside this repository (``throughput/awards.py`` scores the resulting diagnosis, it does not read
the file). Until 2026-09-02 the name was in none of these lists, so a submission that followed the
guide had its WHOLE output tree refused (``path_not_allowed``) and the award had no compliant path
(track3-simulation-private#28, found by NVIDIA). It is admitted by name and bounded like every
other member; the ranked scorer never reads it, so admitting it widens no ranking surface.

Maximum depth 2. The sub list comes from the ORGANIZER's ``batch.json``, never from a directory
listing of what the submission produced — otherwise a submission could widen its own allowlist by
creating directories.

**Why a row bound and not only a byte bound.** Track 3's ranked numerator is the emitted trace's
row count. A padded trace is cheap in bytes (a repeated event compresses extremely well in parquet)
and expensive in rank, so a byte cap is not the bound that matters here. `max_rows_for` expresses
the row bound relative to the organizer's deterministic reference count, enforceable from the
parquet footer before any parser runs.
