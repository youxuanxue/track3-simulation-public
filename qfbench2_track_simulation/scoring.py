"""Track 3 (Market Simulation) CodaBench scoring package.

Exposes ``build_verifier(ctx)`` + ``LEADERBOARD_SORT`` for the shared track-agnostic driver
(`common/codabench/scoring_program/score.py`), which calls ``build_verifier(ctx).run(ctx)``
per unit.

## Two factories, and only one of them ranks

``build_verifier`` is the **production** factory. It requires the trusted evidence the driver now
supplies — ``ctx["run_record"]`` (C2) and ``ctx["plan"]`` (C1) — and it has **no participant-rate
fallback of any kind**. The ranked events/sec comes from
:mod:`qfbench2_track_simulation.telemetry`: host-measured wall clock, Runner-measured parquet-footer
row counts (frozen ruling R-3), telemetry meeting the frozen C7 thresholds, and every repeat
validated. Missing or inadequate evidence is an organizer fault that aborts the evaluation; it is
never a low participant score, and it is never quietly replaced by the submission's own number.

``build_developer_verifier`` is the **developer** factory, for local practice against a harness
that cannot produce trusted timing. It ranks on the local ``host_metrics.json`` measurement or, as
a last resort, the submission's self-report — and every result it emits carries
``rankable = False`` and ``profile = "developer"``. It is not reachable from the platform driver:
the driver calls ``build_verifier`` by name.

That split is the whole remediation. Previously one factory did both, and because the production
ingestion path never wrote the handoff file, the production factory took the developer branch on
every unit.

## Admissibility (shared ``HierarchicalVerifier`` gates g0..g3)

  g0 integrity   — trusted evidence: telemetry admissible, instance exclusive, plan ceiling sane
  g1 schema      — declared fields present, self-consistent, and bound to the TRUSTED scenario
                   (scenario_id, seed and a recomputed trace digest, not merely present)
  g2 cutoff/resource — closed-resource is enforced at ``docker run --network=none``
  g3 domain semantics — exact event coverage + fill sequence + ordering, stylized facts for
                   Family 5, and the message ledger wherever the CARD declares one

Admissible submissions are ranked by events/sec (``LEADERBOARD_SORT = "desc"``).

    Separately named on purpose (global rule 5), and there is still no flag that turns the
    production factory into this one.

    WHAT CHANGED (2026-08-24). This docstring used to end "and no path by which this one reaches
    the platform driver". That was accurate, and it was the defect. Track 3's production score IS a
    host measurement — events/sec from Runner telemetry over Runner-measured parquet row counts,
    frozen ruling R-3 — and the CodaBench Development phase has no Runner. So
    ``require_official_telemetry`` raised ``OrganizerFault`` on every unit and the entire
    Development board aborted, while the factory written for exactly that situation sat
    unreachable. Measured against a Development-shaped C2 (``telemetry: None``, ``repeats: []``):

        build_verifier            OrganizerFault: no admissible ranked-timing telemetry
                                  (['telemetry_absent'])

                                  rankable=False score_source='self_reported'

    The shared driver now selects this factory when — and only when — the C1 plan verified against
    a DEVELOPMENT trust store, i.e. on a board already stamped ``rankable=false`` and
    ``trust_profile="development"``, and it records ``scorer_factory`` in ``scores.json`` so the
    two quantities are never confused. Under production trust the driver cannot reach this
    function at all; that is asserted from the driver's side by
    ``test_production_trust_never_reaches_the_developer_factory``.

    The distinction that makes this safe is the one this factory already draws: production reads a
    rate the organizer MEASURED, this reads one the participant REPORTED. They are different
    quantities, so a board built from this one is unofficial — which is what ``rankable=False``,
    ``profile="developer"`` and ``score_source="self_reported"`` have always said.
