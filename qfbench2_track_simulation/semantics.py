"""Track-3 semantic checks + data extraction for the CodaBench scoring gate.

Track-specific logic (NOT shared scoring math): reconstruct the mid-price / spread / depth
series from a canonical trace, and run the Tier-A (exact event coverage + fill sequence +
Kendall-tau event ordering) and Tier-B (statistical proximity) semantic-regression checks. The
stylized-fact MATH (KS / ACF / Hill / Jensen-Shannon) lives in the shared
``qfbench2_common.scoring.stylized_facts`` and is NOT reimplemented here — this module only
prepares its inputs (mid-price series + depth histograms) and runs the semantic gate.

The same module is imported by the official CodaBench gate (``scoring.py``), the batch isolation
gate (``batch.py``), the private offline oracle and the public practice harness
(``run_regression.py``), so there is exactly one implementation.

## What changed, and why the old comparison was not a comparison

Three properties were previously **not** enforced, and each was independently sufficient to let a
padded or truncated trace pass:

1. **Row-count equality was never checked** on the single-unit path. A Track 3 scenario is
   deterministic given its seed, so a faithful run emits exactly as many rows as the reference.
   Only the batch path asserted that; the single-unit path did not, and the emitted row count is
   the ranked numerator.
2. **The ordering comparison intersected the two key sets** (``common = [k for k in rp if k in
   cp]``), so candidate-only rows were not merely tolerated — they were *invisible*. A candidate
   carrying double the reference's rows scored a perfect Kendall-tau with zero breaches.
3. **The ordering comparison truncated at 50,000 events.** Anything past that index was outside
   the comparison entirely.

All three are gone. Coverage is now exact in both directions: the multiset of
``(identity key, occurrence)`` pairs must match, so a missing event and an extra event are each a
breach, and the ordering statistic runs over the whole trace. Cost is bounded because the row
counts must match first, and the reference row count is organizer-controlled.

## Fault attribution

Breaches returned in the ``(ok, breaches)`` tuple are the **participant's**. Two conditions are
*ours* and are raised instead, so a caller cannot accidentally charge them to a submission:

* :class:`ReferenceIncomplete` — the organizer's reference material cannot support the check that
  the card declares (an empty reference ledger where one is mandatory, for instance).
* :class:`NonfiniteStatistic` — an intermediate statistic came out NaN or infinite. Non-finite
  values in participant *data* are a participant failure and are caught by
  :func:`check_numeric_sanity`; a non-finite *statistic* after that is an instrument fault. The old
  code did neither: it took ``np.log`` of an unguarded price series, and a NaN KS statistic
  compared ``False`` against its ceiling, so an all-zero and an all-negative price stream both
  passed Tier B.
