"""Ranked Track 3 timing, derived only from the trusted C2 run record.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 3's leaderboard number is a measurement, so the thing being measured must not supply it.
Until C2 carried host-measured timing there was no producer of a host measurement on the platform
path, and the read side fell back to the submission's own ``events_per_sec`` whenever no
measurement was present — which was always. Both halves of the fraction were then the participant's: ``n_events`` was pinned to the
emitted trace, but ``wall_clock_sec`` was compared against nothing, so an honest trace with a
shrunken clock passed every consistency check at an arbitrary rank.

The producer now exists. C2 carries host-measured ``timing``, per-repeat records, Runner-measured
``output_row_counts`` read from the parquet footer (frozen ruling R-3), and telemetry with GPU
attribution. **This module is the only source of a ranked Track 3 rate, and it has no fallback.**
There is no environment flag, no strict mode, and no "measurement absent" branch that still returns
a number. A developer profile that ranks on a self-report exists in
:mod:`qfbench2_track_simulation.host_metrics`, is reachable only through a separately named
factory, and stamps ``rankable = False`` on everything it emits.

## What is checked before a rate exists

1. **Telemetry meets the frozen C7 thresholds** — 50 ms sampling, coverage >= 0.95, at most five
   consecutive missed samples, GPU resolved by **UUID** and attributed to the participant cgroup.
   Device-index-only telemetry is inadmissible; the contract's own parser refuses it outright.
2. **The instance was otherwise idle.** Track 3's fairness rule is "same pinned, otherwise-idle
   instance", so a shared or thermally throttled window is not a comparable measurement.
3. **Every repeat is validated, not just the last.** The plan commits ``repeats`` and
   ``warmup_discarded``; C2 must carry exactly that many repeat records, each individually
   rankable, and — because a Track 3 scenario is deterministic given its seed — each measured
   repeat's ``output_tree_digest`` and ``event_count`` must equal the tree that was actually
   scored. That is what closes alternating fast-invalid / slow-valid repeats *regardless of which
   repeat happened to be retained*: a repeat that produced different bytes cannot match the digest
   of the tree the semantic gates read.
4. **The numerator is the Runner's, and it must equal the reference.** R-3 gives the row count to
   the Runner; Track 3 verifies it against the organizer's reference count. A padded trace is
   refused at the numerator as well as by the semantic gate, so extra rows can never buy rank.

## Fault attribution

Unestablished telemetry, a missing repeat record, a contended box, a non-finite intermediate
statistic: **organizer faults**, which abort the whole evaluation. The participant did not cause
them and must never be charged a zero for them.

Repeats that disagree with the scored tree: a **participant failure**. The submission's own output
was not reproducible across the repeats the protocol ran.
