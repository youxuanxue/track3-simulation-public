"""The C1 clip ceiling is derived from the roster, and 2,000,000 events/sec is refused.

The shipped C1 simulation fixture carries ``metric.domain.max = 2000000.0``, and the agent that
wrote it recorded that it had **invented** the figure because frozen ruling R-2 demanded a finite
maximum and supplied none. This file is the ratification decision, expressed as executable
assertions rather than as prose:

* 2e6 sits **below** the published competitive band for a batch only eight markets wide
  (8 x 600,000 = 4,800,000), and two orders of magnitude below the widest batch the track ships.
  A ceiling below an attainable honest score does not bound an exploit — ``W`` is the domain
  *minimum*, so R-2's property is carried entirely by the floor — it deletes ranking information at
  the top and ties every strong submission at the ceiling.
* The replacement is a rule evaluated against the roster being scored, not another constant, and
  the production gate refuses a plan that fails it. An invented ceiling cannot silently govern the
  top of the board again.
