"""The developer profile cannot rank, and the rankable fallback is gone.

This file used to pin the OPPOSITE behaviour: that ``host_metrics.resolve`` returns the
submission's self-reported events/sec when the harness recorded no measurement, "which preserves
today's behaviour on a harness that does not yet emit the file". As measured, the harness never
emitted the file on the production path, so that branch was taken on every unit and the
leaderboard ranked numbers the submissions chose.

C2 now carries host-measured timing, so the fallback is removed rather than flagged. What is left
in :mod:`qfbench2_track_simulation.host_metrics` is a *developer profile*: a local practice reader
whose every result is ``rankable = False``. These tests assert the removal (the regression), the
developer profile's honesty about what it is, and the plausibility bound that still applies to a
self-report on that profile.

Docker-free and dependency-free: no trace is read, only the score-selection logic.

``host_metrics`` imports nothing outside the stdlib, but its PACKAGE does — importing
``qfbench2_track_simulation`` runs an ``__init__`` that pulls in ``.scoring`` and therefore pandas.
The secret-free CI job installs pyarrow only, so the module is loaded straight from its file to
keep the test honest about its dependencies rather than widening the job to accommodate it.
