"""Malicious participant output is refused before a Track 3 parser sees it.

Two halves.

**The shared corpus.** ``qfbench2_common.contracts.fixtures.make_malicious_trees`` generates the
19-case adversarial set every workstream in this program shares, with each case's expected verdict
as data rather than prose. Track 3 runs it rather than inventing a twentieth corpus, because a case
one repo omits is exactly the case that ships.

**Track 3's own allowlist and retention path.** The local harness used to copy the run's output
with ``shutil.copytree(out_dir, keep_output)`` and the default ``symlinks=False``, which flattens a
participant symlink and copies its TARGET's bytes into the retained tree. Retention now goes
through the shared C3 sanitizer with Track 3's exact allowlist.

### Test-environment caveat, binding on acceptance

``case-collision`` and ``unicode-collision`` **cannot be constructed on macOS**: APFS folds case
and normalises Unicode, so the second name in each pair resolves to the first and there is no
collision to refuse. The generator reports them as unbuildable with that reason and this file skips
them with the reason attached. **They must be exercised in Linux CI**, and A06 may not be closed on
the strength of a local green run.
