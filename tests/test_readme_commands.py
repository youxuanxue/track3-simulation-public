"""The README's quick start is executable documentation, so this executes it.

    python tests/test_readme_commands.py

Four published statements were wrong at the same time, and each of them costs a participant a
working session before it costs anyone else anything:

  * ``(cd abides-jpmc-public && pip install -e ".[all]")`` -- measured exit 1. ABIDES is a
    multi-package repository with no top-level ``setup.py``/``pyproject.toml`` and no ``[all]``
    extra, so pip answers "does not appear to be a Python project". The repo's own baseline
    recipe (``baselines/Dockerfile``) has always named the two subdirectories instead.
  * ``python throughput/timer.py --image abides-baseline:latest`` -- measured exit 2.
    ``--scenario`` is ``required=True`` in ``timer.py``'s own parser, and the README published
    the invocation three times without it.
  * ``python -m qfbench2_common.scoring.stylized_facts --candidate ... --reference ...`` --
    measured exit 0, output: nothing. The module defines no ``argparse`` parser and no
    ``__main__`` block, so both flags are ignored and a silent no-op reads as "nothing wrong".
  * the shared-toolkit install line points at a private repository, so it exits 1 for every
    participant. That one is not fixable here; what is fixable is the README asserting it works.

Stdlib-only by construction -- the timer's parser is loaded straight from its file -- so this runs
in the firewall job alongside the other no-secret guards.
