"""Tests for the LOCAL DEVELOPER unit runner and the node fingerprint.

Docker-free and hermetic: these cover routing, parsing, staging, comparability, the bounds on the
container invocation, and the non-rankability stamp. The end-to-end container behaviour lives in
``tests/integration/`` behind an explicit marker.

Two things are asserted here that used to be asserted the other way round:

* ``_reclaim_output`` is GONE. It re-invoked the PARTICIPANT'S image after the timed window to
  chown the output tree, and the old tests pinned its argv. The replacement is no re-invocation at
  all: cleanup is host-side and best-effort, with ``--run-as-host-user`` as the opt-in that makes
  it clean. Running a participant image for a housekeeping task is a production dependency on
  executing untrusted code for organizer convenience, and it does not belong in either path.
  (Those tests were also the only non-hermetic ones in the suite: one of them called the un-mocked
  helper, which shelled out to a real ``docker run`` and, on a networked runner, attempted a
  registry pull.)
* the record says ``rankable = False``. The old record called itself "authoritative".
