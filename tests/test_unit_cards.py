"""Card invariants that the generators must keep reproducing.

Two of these are drift guards. A unit's ``card.toml`` is generated (``scripts/build_public_units.py``
for flat units, ``scripts/build_batch_units.py`` for batch ones), so a value edited in the committed
cards but not in the generator survives only until the next regeneration. That happened: every card
carried ``[environment] gpu = true`` while both generators still emitted ``false``, so regenerating
the suite would have silently reverted the only ``gpu = true`` cards in the competition.

  * ``test_every_card_requests_a_gpu`` pins the value in the committed cards.
  * ``test_generators_emit_the_committed_environment_block`` pins the generators to it, which is the
    half that actually prevents the revert.
  * ``test_every_card_carries_a_scenario_family`` pins the input ``cluster_key`` reads. A card
    without one falls back to a singleton cluster in the hub's bootstrap, silently, and the
    published confidence interval comes out too narrow.
  * ``test_every_card_declares_whether_a_message_ledger_is_required`` and its generator half pin
    the newest card field. The ledger gate used to trigger on whether a reference
    ``message_trace.parquet`` happened to exist, so an unshipped reference file switched the
    latency-causality check off silently. It is a declaration now, and a declaration that only the
    committed cards carry is one regeneration away from vanishing.

Stdlib-only by default so this runs in the firewall CI job, which does not install the shared
toolkit and therefore still runs when that install breaks. The one toolkit-backed check is named
in the output when it is skipped: a partial pass is not a full validation and must not be read as
one.
