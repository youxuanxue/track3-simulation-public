"""LOCAL DEVELOPER harness for timing one Track 3 unit. It cannot produce an official number.

## Executive summary (read this first)

This module used to describe itself as the "worker-side authoritative runner", and the description
was the problem: a Track 3 launcher standing in for the production timing path. The Runner owns
participant launch, lifecycle, timing, C2 and C3 on the platform (global rule 3); Track 3 owns the
semantic rules, the telemetry requirements, and this clearly non-rankable developer harness.

**Everything this module writes is stamped ``rankable = False`` and ``profile = "developer"``.** The
production scorer factory reads the C2 run record and has no path that reads a
``host_metrics.json`` written here. Use it to time your own image locally; it will not tell you
where you would rank.

Three bounds, because a practice run still executes an untrusted image on somebody's workstation:
a hard deadline and capped log capture (see ``throughput.timer.bounded_container_run``), a
C3-compatible **no-follow sanitizing** copy for retained output, and no re-invocation of the
participant image for any reason.

What it measures, when it can:

* **events/sec is host-measured on both sides of the fraction**: the event count is the row count of
  the emitted ``trace.parquet`` (read from the parquet footer), and the wall clock is this process's.
  Neither number comes from the submission. The count the submission declares in its own
  ``events.json`` is read only to cross-check, and a mismatch fails the run. Repeated ``--runs``
  times with the first discarded as warm-up, reported as the median.
* **host telemetry** (`host_gpu_seconds` via NVML, `host_peak_memory_bytes` via the container
  cgroup) rides along, so the telemetry-dependent awards rank on measured values (WS-1).
* **the node fingerprint** is recorded with every timed run, which the T3 fairness rule requires
  (hub ``docs/30-EVAL-INFRA.md`` §4): a fingerprint change invalidates cross-run comparability.
* **both verbs** are supported. A batch unit (``batch.json`` + ``scenarios/``) is run with
  ``simulate-batch``; the shared ingestion program only knows the single-scenario ``simulate``.

Only the scenario inputs are mounted, never a unit's reference answers, matching what the sealed
ingestion tree contains.

Usage::

    python -m throughput.run_unit --image <img> --unit units/t3-fastlob-core --out record.json
    python -m throughput.run_unit --image <img> --unit units/t3-gbatch-dense-3 --runs 3

    Two measured defects are closed here.

    ``shutil.copytree(out_dir, keep_output)`` used the default ``symlinks=False``, so a participant
    symlink was **flattened and its target's bytes copied into the retained tree** -- verified
    locally to walk into ``/etc`` and reach ``master.passwd`` before permission errors stopped it.
    A symlink to a directory made copytree recurse into it; a dangling one made copytree raise,
    turning a successful timed run into a harness exception. That is raw participant output copied
    with no sanitation at all.

    The replacement is ``qfbench2_common.sanitize``: a directory-FD-relative no-follow walk that
    refuses symlinks, hard links, FIFOs, sockets, devices and every other non-regular node,
    enforces Track 3's exact allowed relative paths (``qfbench2_track_simulation.limits``), copies
    validated bytes into a fresh directory and hashes the COPIES, then promotes atomically.

    ``materialize_tree`` rather than ``sanitize_participant_tree``, deliberately: the latter also
    emits a C3 descriptor and therefore requires the destination's parent to contain nothing else.
    A local run keeps one directory per unit under a shared run root -- that is where the
    developer ``host_metrics.json`` sits -- so the parent is never exclusive and the descriptor
    would be a false claim. C3 is the Runner's to produce; what the local harness needs is the
    no-follow policy, and it takes it from the same implementation rather than a second one.

    Imported lazily so the argv and routing tests, which run in the secret-free CI job, do not need
    the toolkit.
