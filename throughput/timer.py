"""
Track 3 throughput measurement protocol -- the LOCAL DEVELOPER HARNESS. It cannot rank.

## Executive summary (read this first)

**This module is not the official timing path and never produces an official number.** The Runner
owns participant launch, lifecycle, timing, C2 and C3 on the platform; Track 3 owns the semantic
rules and the telemetry requirements the Runner's evidence must satisfy. Every record this harness
emits carries ``rankable = False`` and ``profile = "developer"``, and the production scorer factory
(`qfbench2_track_simulation.scoring.build_verifier`) has no path that reads it.

Three bounds make the local harness safe to point at an untrusted image, because a practice run
still executes participant code on somebody's workstation:

* **a hard deadline** on every container invocation (`DEFAULT_RUN_TIMEOUT_SEC`), enforced by
  killing the container through its cidfile and then the client process. Previously
  `subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)` was called with no `timeout=`, so an image that
  never exits hung the harness forever;
* **capped log capture**: output is drained continuously -- so the container never blocks on a full
  pipe -- but only the last `LOG_TAIL_BYTES` of each stream is retained. Previously `PIPE` buffered
  the container's entire stdout in harness memory, which a stdout flood turns into an OOM;
* **no re-invocation of the participant image**, for cleanup or anything else. Cleanup is host-side
  and best-effort.

Runs a candidate Docker image N times (default 5) with different seeds drawn from a
seed family derived from the scenario's base seed, discards the first run as warm-up,
and reports the median events/sec alongside the full distribution.

Warm-up rationale
-----------------
The first container invocation in a sequence typically runs slower than subsequent
ones due to several cold-start effects that are not intrinsic to the simulator's
algorithmic performance:

  1. JIT compilation caches (Numba, JAX XLA, etc.): the first run compiles kernels
     and writes LLVM IR / cubin artefacts to ``/tmp`` or ``~/.cache``; subsequent
     runs reuse these caches via mmap.  On a fresh container the cache is cold.
  2. OS page cache: the first run reads the scenario JSON and any supporting data
     files from NVMe; subsequent runs read from the OS buffer cache (RAM).
  3. Python import overhead: even though Docker images contain ``.pyc`` files,
     the first ``import`` statement for each module causes a ``stat(2)`` cascade
     that warms the dentry cache.

Discarding the first run (``--discard-warmup``, enabled by default) therefore gives
a **steady-state** measurement that is a fairer proxy for production throughput.  If
you are benchmarking a pure-C binary with no JIT, you can pass ``--no-discard-warmup``
to include all runs; the first run is then identical in cost to the rest.

Usage (CLI)
-----------
::

    python timer.py \\
        --image ghcr.io/my-org/my-sim:latest \\
        --scenario /path/to/scenario.json \\
        --runs 5 \\
        --discard-warmup \\
        --output results.json

Usage (Python API)
------------------
::

    from timer import measure_throughput, ThroughputResult
    from pathlib import Path

    result = measure_throughput(
        image="ghcr.io/my-org/my-sim:latest",
        scenario_path=Path("/path/to/scenario.json"),
        runs=5,
        discard_warmup=True,
    )
    print(f"Median: {result.median_events_per_sec:,.0f} events/sec")
    print(f"Std:    {result.std_events_per_sec:,.0f} events/sec")

        traceability in result archives.
    seed_family : list[int]
        The full list of seeds passed to each run (including the warm-up
        seed at index 0, even if that run was discarded from statistics).
    raw_events_per_sec : list[float]
        events/sec for each run in seed-family order.  If ``warmup_discarded``
        is True, the first entry corresponds to the discarded warm-up run and
        is included here for auditing purposes but is **not** used in any of
        the aggregate statistics below.
    warmup_discarded : bool
        Whether the first run was excluded from the aggregate statistics.
    median_events_per_sec : float
        Median over the scored runs (i.e. all runs if warmup_discarded is
        False, runs[1:] otherwise).
    mean_events_per_sec : float
        Arithmetic mean over the scored runs.
    std_events_per_sec : float
        Population standard deviation over the scored runs.  Returns 0.0 if
        only one run was scored.
    min_events_per_sec : float
        Minimum over the scored runs.
    max_events_per_sec : float
        Maximum over the scored runs.

        Wall-clock elapsed time (seconds) for each container invocation, in
        the same order as ``raw_events_per_sec``.
    host_gpu_seconds : list[float | None]
        Host-measured GPU busy-time (utilization-weighted seconds, sampled via NVML) for each run,
        or ``None`` for a run where no GPU / NVML was present. This is the INDEPENDENT measurement
        that the awards pipeline consumes instead of a submission's self-reported ``gpu_seconds``.
    median_host_gpu_seconds : float | None
        Median host GPU-seconds over the scored runs, or ``None`` if none were measured.
    host_peak_memory_bytes : list[int | None]
        Host-measured peak container resident memory (cgroup) for each run, or ``None`` where the
        cgroup was not readable. The independent counterpart to self-reported ``peak_memory_bytes``.

    result carries a negative return code, so an image that never exits costs one timeout rather
    than the harness.

# Seed derivation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


def derive_seed_family(base_seed: int, n: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Deterministically derive *n* independent seeds from *base_seed*.

    The derivation uses SHA-256 hash chaining so that seeds are unpredictable
    from the base seed without computing the hashes, and so that seeds for
    different positions *i* are independent even when base seeds differ by 1.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    For each ``i`` in ``range(n)``::

        raw = hashlib.sha256(f"{base_seed}:{i}".encode()).hexdigest()
        seed_i = int(raw, 16) & 0x7FFF_FFFF   # truncate to 31 bits

    The 31-bit mask ensures compatibility with simulators that use
    ``numpy.random.default_rng(seed)`` or ``random.seed(seed)`` with
    platform-specific int width constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_seed : int
        The scenario's ``base_seed`` as read from ``scenario.json``.
    n : int
        Number of seeds to generate.  Must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    list[int]
        A list of *n* non-negative integers, each < 2**31.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> derive_seed_family(42, 3)

    Run one container invocation and return its :class:`RunMetrics`.

    The function:

    1. Creates a temporary directory for ``/input`` and writes a seed-patched copy
       of *scenario_path* there (the original file is never modified).
    2. Optionally uses the caller-supplied *output_dir* for ``/output``, or creates
       its own temporary directory.
    3. Invokes::

           docker run --rm --network=none \\
               --cpus=<cpus> --memory=<memory> \\
               -v <input_dir>:/input:ro \\
               -v <output_dir>:/output \\
               <image> simulate --config /input/scenario.json --out /output/trace.parquet

    4. Times the subprocess with ``time.monotonic``.
    5. Reads ``/output/events.json`` and extracts ``n_events``.
    6. Returns a :class:`RunMetrics` with ``events_per_sec`` and the host-measured fields.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : str
        Docker image reference (e.g. ``"ghcr.io/my-org/my-sim:sha-abc1234"``).
    scenario_path : Path
        Path to the scenario JSON on the host filesystem.
    seed : int
        Seed to inject into the scenario JSON under the key ``"seed"``.
    cpus : str
        Value for Docker ``--cpus`` flag.  Default ``"4"`` matches the official
        benchmark hardware allocation.
    memory : str
        Value for Docker ``--memory`` flag.  Default ``"16g"`` matches the
        official benchmark hardware allocation.
    output_dir : Path | None
        If provided, use this directory for container output (must be writable).
        If None, a temporary directory is created and cleaned up automatically.

    Returns
    -------
    RunMetrics
        ``events_per_sec`` plus the harness-measured ``host_wall_clock_sec``,
        ``host_gpu_seconds`` (``None`` on a CPU-only box), and ``host_peak_memory_bytes``
        (``None`` when the container cgroup is not readable from this host).

    Raises
